World Chase Tag ([About](https://www.worldchasetag.com/about) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/WorldChaseTag)) is the first and only league for competative tag which holds national and international competitions. Many of the athletes are parkour practitioners.  
I created a [Dashboard using Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/jacwercode/wct/Dashboard.py) to generate analytics and visualizations for my favorite sport that I can share with friends and family.

[Predicting Employee Attrition](https://github.com/JacWerCode/SpringboardCapstoneProjects/tree/main/CS1_EmployeeAttrition)  
It's important to identify which employees are at risk for attrition and more importantly, why they quit and how to retain workers. We can use data to reduce pain points to create better environments for employees, reducing administrative costs of onboarding, and freeing up time supervisors/mentors use to bring a new hire up to speed, which could be used working on projects and developing strategy.

[Predicting Martial Status by opinion](https://github.com/JacWerCode/SpringboardCapstoneProjects/tree/main/CS2_MaritalStatus)   
Divorce is a stressful and costly process that takes a toll on individuals, families, and their friends. Barring a situation where staying married would do more harm than good, divorces are better to be avoided and a marriage mended. Ideally, we find out which attitudes towards marriage, cohabitation, family, are predictive of divorce â€“ and that these are attitudes that can be changed
